# first-html-portfolio
This is my "first" portfolio under the lessons from Angela Yu. Doing both Odin Project and her course
Just raw html and images. I took bad screenshots but it would do for now. Moving onto relearning CSS and maybe I will make changes in the future to this page as well as the Odin recipes
